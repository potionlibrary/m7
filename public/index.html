                    <h3>About Web Servers</h3>

                    <p>In the context of a web server, the index.html file acts as the starting point of a web session.
                         This webpage provides users with a central hub from which they can navigate to various sections
                         of the website.
                         This convention simplifies the user experience by offering easy access to essential tabs like
                         home, shop, learn, and support.</p>

                    <p>The main difference between viewing from the web server and locally running index.html is the URL
                         format. Web server URLs typically start with http:// or https://, while local URLs start
                         with file://, this implies that there is a difference in protocols used to manipulate the
                         content.
                         In the browser's Network tab, you can see details regarding the user's session, when running
                         the file locally these trails are absent unless the user has configured their own local web
                         server to serve the files.</p>

                    <p>The files main.css, main.js, and favico.ico can be considered separate items that have to be
                         requested and served by the web server. The file favicon.ico produces a status 200 because it's
                         automatically requested and served by the web server.
                         In contrast, main.css and main.js lack status codes because the web server has not been
                         instructed to fetch them. </p>

                    <p>
                         The scheme specifies the protocol used to access the resource. In this case:
                         <strong>https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~wagnejua/M1/a1-wagnejua/index.html</strong> it is
                         HTTPS, which is just HTTP with a TLS/SSL wrapper that uses port 443. It indicates that the data
                         exchanged between the web browser and the web server is encrypted for security.
                         In this URL, web is the subdomain. Subdomains are used to organize and categorize content
                         under a main domain. They are typically used for different sections or purposes within a
                         website.
                         The subdomain web may also indicate a specific department or area within Oregon State
                         University's engineering website. The host is the main domain name that identifies the location
                         of the resource.
                         In our case, <strong>engr.oregonstate.edu</strong> is the host domain. This part of the URL
                         identifies the server where the resource is hosted. It points to the specific web server within
                         Oregon State University's engineering department.
                         The path specifies the location of the specific resource or file on the web server,
                         <strong>~wagnejua/M1/a1-wagnejua/index.html</strong> is the path. It's like a directory
                         structure that guides the server to the exact file requested by the client.
                         In this case, it leads to a file named index.html.

                    <h3>Frontend Design:</h3>

                    <p>Frontend design, in the context of web development, refers to the process of designing and
                         creating the user interface and visual presentation of a website
                         or web application that users interact with. It involves various aspects, including layout,
                         typography, colors, images, and user experience (UX) design.</p>

                    <dl>
                         <dt><strong>Effective:</strong></dt>
                         <dd>This means the system or website helps users achieve their goals accurately. When users
                              use
                              it, they should get the correct and expected results.</dd>
                         <dt><strong>Efficient: </strong></dt>
                         <dd>The system should allow users to perform tasks with as few steps as
                              possible.
                              Users should be able to get the results they want quickly, without unnecessary delays or
                              actions.</dd>
                         <dt><strong>Easy to Navigate: </strong></dt>
                         <dd>Easy to Navigate: This is about making it simple for all users, especially newcomers,
                              to
                              find what they're looking for. Users should easily understand how to access their goals,
                              whether through clicking links or searching, and remember how to do it next time.</dd>
                         <dt><strong>Error-Free: </strong></dt>
                         <dd>Error-Free: The system should minimize errors to ensure it's accessible and available
                              to
                              all users. This involves learning about common mistakes users might make and preventing
                              these errors. Users should not encounter obstacles due to their specific needs or
                              misunderstandings.</dd>
                         <dt><strong>Enjoyable to Use: </strong></dt>
                         <dd>Enjoyable to Use: The system should be enjoyable and engaging for users. It should
                              cater to
                              the unique preferences and needs of its target audience, both in terms of content and
                              design. Users should want to return to it because of the positive experiences they have
                              had, which include the previous four E's and the overall user experience.</dd>

                    <p>The <strong>header</strong> tag is used to define the introductory section of a webpage, often
                         containing logos, navigation menus, and introductory content.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>footer</strong> tag represents the concluding section of a page, typically housing
                         copyright notices and contact information.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>nav</strong> tag identifies a section containing navigation links, aiding users in
                         exploring the website easily.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>main</strong> tag signifies the primary content of a page, focusing on the central
                         topic.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>section</strong> tag creates distinct sections within a webpage, each with its own
                         heading, facilitating the organization of content.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>article</strong> section tag creates distinct sections within a webpage, each with
                         its own heading, facilitating the organization of content.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>aside</strong> tag is used for content that is tangentially related to the main
                         content of a webpage, but can be considered separate from it. This typically includes sidebars,
                         pull
                         quotes, advertisements, or supplementary information that complements the primary content.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>figure</strong> tag is used to encapsulate any content that is referenced from the
                         main content, such as images, illustrations, diagrams, charts, or videos. It provides a way to
                         group related content together.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>blockquote</strong> tag is used to indicate that a block of text within a webpage is
                         a quotation from another source. It typically includes the quoted text and may be styled to
                         distinguish it from the surrounding content.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>div</strong> tag, short for division, is a versatile and commonly used HTML
                         container element that does not inherently impart any specific semantic meaning.</p>

                    <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>

                    <ol>
                         <p><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong> The physical dimensions (width and height) of an image on
                              a web page should match the intended display size. This reduces unnecessary file size and
                              ensures images fit their containers without resizing by the browser.</p>

                         <p><strong>File Format:</strong> Choosing the right file format is crucial. For photos and
                              images with complex color gradients, JPEG is preferred due to its lossy compression. For
                              images with transparency or sharp lines (like logos), PNG is suitable due to lossless
                              compression. WebP is an emerging format that offers both compression efficiency and
                              quality.</p>

                         <p><strong>Compression Level:</strong> Balancing image quality and file size, adjusting the
                              compression level is vital. Higher compression reduces file size, but may degrade image
                              quality. Finding the right balance is essential.</p>

                         <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> For the web, images are typically displayed at 72 DPI (dots per
                              inch). A higher DPI is unnecessary and increases file size without visual benefit.</p>

                         <p><strong>Image File Size:</strong> Smaller file sizes result in faster page loading. Compress
                              images as much as possible without compromising visual quality. Online image compression
                              tools can help achieve this.</p>

                         <p><strong>Alt Text:</strong> Including descriptive alt text in the HTML image tag is essential
                              for accessibility. It provides context and information about the image to users who rely
                              on screen readers or face slow internet connections.</p>

                    <h3>Favicons</h3>

                    <ol>
                         <p><strong>Website Identification:</strong> Favicons primarily serve as visual identifiers for
                              websites. Browsers display them in tabs, bookmarks, and favorites, allowing users to
                              quickly recognize and access their preferred websites.</p>

                         <p><strong>Home Screen Icons:</strong> On mobile devices and some browsers, websites added to
                              the home screen can use favicons as app icons. This makes it convenient for users to
                              access web apps as if they were native applications.</p>

                         <p><strong>Tab Switching:</strong> In tabbed interfaces, users can identify and switch between
                              open tabs by clicking on the tab's favicon. This enhances navigation when multiple tabs
                              are in use.</p>

                         <p><strong>Notifications:</strong> Favicons may display notifications or badges to indicate
                              updates or unread content. This visual cue helps users stay informed without switching
                              tabs.</p>

                         <p><strong>Security Indicators:</strong> Security-conscious browsers use favicons to provide
                              visual security indicators. For example, a padlock icon may overlay the favicon to signify
                              a secure, SSL/TLS-protected website, reassuring users about their data's safety.</p>

                         <p><strong>Offline Mode:</strong> In offline or slow-loading scenarios, browsers may use cached
                              favicons to maintain a consistent visual experience even when website resources are
                              unavailable or slow to load.</p>

                    <h3>Form Usability and Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Forms are essential elements of web usability and accessibility. They serve various purposes,
                         including capturing user input, processing data, and facilitating user interactions. To ensure
                         that forms are accessible to all users, there are six major goals of accessible forms:</p>
                    <ol>
                         <li>Perceivable: Forms should be easily distinguishable, and users should be able to perceive

                         <li>Operable: Forms should be operable through various input methods, including keyboard
                              navigation.</li>
                         <li>Understandable: Forms should have clear and concise instructions, and users should
                              understand how to complete them.</li>
                         <li>Robust: Forms should be robust and compatible with different user agents and assistive
                              technologies.</li>
                         <li>Consistent: Forms should follow consistent design patterns and conventions.</li>
                         <li>Feedback: Forms should provide appropriate feedback to users after submission or error
                              occurrences.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Node, npm, and Express</h3>
                    <p>Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), and Express.js are powerful technologies in web development.
                         They play essential roles in modern web applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run
                              JavaScript on the server-side. It is known for its non-blocking, event-driven
                              architecture, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance web
                              applications.</li>
                         <li><strong>npm (Node Package Manager):</strong> npm is the default package manager for
                              Node.js. It provides a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries that simplify the
                              development process by offering reusable code and modules.</li>
                         <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It
                              simplifies the creation of web applications by providing a robust set of features for
                              routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Together, these technologies enable developers to build efficient, server-side applications and
                         RESTful APIs, enhancing the web development experience and enabling the creation of dynamic and
                         responsive web applications.</p>
